Hey! I'm Joel, although online I tend to go by the username 'joll05'. I like to make videogames and take photos. Sometimes I make music as well.

This is my github page. Here you'll find some of the projects I've worked on, both on my own and with other people. Most of my public repositories are licensed using the MIT license, meaning that you can use my code and assets freely in your own projects as long as you include the same license. Some of my projects I've also released into the public domain, meaning that you can use and distribute them freely without any conditions.
